This is a simple reporting tool application that I made to practice using websockets as well as
to have a reporting tool that I have made by scratch. I developed this because I was heavily inspired
by reporting tools like Grafana or Prometheus that use graphs to visualize the metric data coming in. So 
far, this only monitors pings and web requests (http/https) which you can use to monitor the availability 
of your network infrastructure or web application.
